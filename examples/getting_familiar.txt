Experimenting with Beautiful Soup on the WikiPedia Home Page


Import the Necessary Libraries
-----
	import urllib
	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

Retrieve Wikipedia HomePage and Soupify It
-----
	page = urllib.urlopen('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page').read()
	soup = BeautifulSoup(page)

Call children on the Soup
-----
	soup.head
	soup.html
	soup.body
	soup.div

	Finds the first instance of tag and returns it

Get Children of a Tag
-----
	soup.body.div - Grabs the first div tag in the body
	soup.head.title

Get String/Text of a Tag
-----
	soup.title.string - Works if only one child and it's a NavigableString 
	soup.p.get_text() - Works more generally, returns Unicode, not Object


Get Linked Articles from Wikipedia Home Page
-----
	tags = soup.find('table', id='mp-upper').find_all('b')
	- Wikipedia Wraps their links in bold tags

	Loop Over <b> tags and store in array
	----
	urls = []
	for tag in tags:
		if tag.a and tag.a.get('href'):
			urls.append(tag.a.get('href'))

	Now you have all of the Article Links on the home page. You also have a few extra, which you can then further filter out as you need.
